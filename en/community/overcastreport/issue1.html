              <h3 id="development">Development News</h3>
            </div>
            <p>It's been a busy week on the development front, with plenty of new features for mapmakers.</p>
            <p><a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Elliott_">Elliott_</a> gave a <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/556e1e12c29635f0690008e1">thorough breakdown of the changes</a>, which include new ways of applying kits, custom crafting recipes, punchable blocks for players in adventure mode, and ways of reacting to players walking over blocks. As always, mapmakers will be able to combine these with other modules to create new gameplay mechanics.</p>
            <p>Here's a summary of the rest of the development news from this week:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mobile users, tired of having to log yourself back in every week or so? Well no longer! Thanks to <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Apple">Apple</a> pushing a quick fix, as long as you log in once a month, you should never find your phone logged out without your doing.</li>
              <li>Renewables have been reimplemented using a much more efficient algorithm. They can now be literally infinite in size without causing any performance problems. In fact, they are now infinite by default, if you don't specify a region. A new option was also added called "interval", which specifies the average time required for a block to renew. This time is independent of other renewing blocks, which causes large renewables to "grow" back in a more natural way. The <a href="https://docs.oc.tc/modules/renewables">XML documentation</a> has been updated to reflect the changes.</li>
              <li>We've also fixed an issue that was causing certain languages not to appear in game, despite having translations.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="page-header">
              <h3 id="rotations">Rotations News</h3>
            </div>
            <p>After weeks of hard work by <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Strangey">Strangey</a>, <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Anthonny">Anthonny</a> and the rest of the map development team, the <a href="https://oc.tc/maps/rotation/517c86f293b6df5aab0f2ece">Blitz</a> and <a href="https://oc.tc/maps/rotation/519d7f0c77b05e9ab6050d21">Rage</a> rotations got a huge update this week! You can read more about the changes in <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/556a91345f35b99909005a61">Strangey's post here</a>. Blitz and Rage are really fun, fast-paced gamemodes and we recommend checking out the new rotations.</p>
            <p>Also, Strangey has hinted that the mini rotations may be next in line for a refresh. Watch this space!</p>
            <div class="page-header">
              <h3 id="thelastlife">Blitz Tournament: The Last Life</h3>
            </div>
            <p><a href="https://oc.tc/stats/SheriffSoco">SheriffSoco</a> has been putting together what looks set to be an awesome mini tournament in the Blitz gamemode. The event will be taking place over the next two weekends, and 40 teams are enrolled. Those not taking part will of course be able to enjoy livestreams of the event.</p>
            <p>The map pool is expected to be announced today, so look out for the announcement post later. And check out the <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/556b713cc29635281b0075cf">update post</a> for more details about the event.</p>

              <h3 id="cloudy">New Map Development Server Launched</h3>
            </div>
            <p><a href="https://oc.tc/stats/ShinyDialga">ShinyDialga</a> has been kind enough to put together a great resource for map makers of all shapes and sizes! <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/556cceee5f35b9cd8c00030e">Cloudy</a> is a public map development server that compiles many useful plugins for map makers, and should prove to be a great resource for our community.</p>
            <p>Cloudy is currently in a beta phase, and an application is required to join the whitelist, but Shiny is hoping to make the server fully public soon. If you've ever wanted to take a crack at map building, but don't know where to get started, Cloudy is the place for you!</p>

              <h3 id="icaruses">Is This the Reason Why Icaruses Don't Work Properly in 1.8?</h3>
            </div>
            <p>One of our regulars, and known development junkie, <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/twiz_mwazin">twiz_mwazin</a>, started some research into the TNT bug that has been plaguing any icarus cannon made on our servers since the 1.8 update. With the help of <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/ny_">ny_</a>, they have figured out that the problem lies with Craftbukkit, and not with PGM, as many people had previously thought. In his <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/556b75e0c29635fe3f007fad">thread</a>, Twiz has said that he reported the issue on <a href="https://hub.spigotmc.org/jira/browse/SPIGOT-949">Spigot's issue tracker</a>, so hopefully we will see things improve soon.</p>
            <div class="page-header">
              <h3 id="staff">Staff News</h3>
            </div>
            <p>The staff team continues to grow - this week saw two more brand new Junior Moderators join the <a href="https://oc.tc/staff">team</a>. Both of them come from France, so it's great to have more staff in EU timezones. Bienvenue <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Yuuki">Yuuki</a> et <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Guicotsch">Guicotsch</a>!</p>
            <p>In fact, they are the last two juniors in the current batch, which also included <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Anthonny">Anthonny</a>, <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/felipu_feliu">felipu_feliu</a>, <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Diamyx">Diamyx</a>, <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Rahuul">Rahuul</a> and <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Santilam">Santilam</a>, as well as the return of former mods <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/m0ose12321">m0ose12321</a>, <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/igloo1">igloo1</a>, <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Moo_">Moo_</a> and <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/PepsiDog">PepsiDog</a>. We'll be starting work on the next batch now... who do you think will be <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/52ae349aaf7fb095ae001a9d">next</a>?</p>
            <p>We also saw the official launch of a brand new staff position this week. <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Monti">Monti</a> joined as our first Lead Translator. Read on to find out more about Monti's role.</p>
            <div class="page-header">
              <h3 id="leadtranslator">Welcome to our New Lead Translator</h3>
            </div>
            <p>This week, <a href="https://oc.tc/stats/Monti">Monti</a> <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/556970bac29635fa04002c4f">officially joined the staff team</a> as our first Lead Translator. He's already been working hard to put together a team of translators to cover the enormous range of languages spoken by members of the OCN community, and they've been working hard to improve the translations of the many different in-game messages players see when on OCN.</p>
            <p>The team is still looking for more volunteers who can help translate - you can <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5569bd51c296350d51004660">find out more about how you can help here</a>. Monti says that he's particularly keen to find people who can help with Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Chinese and Japanese, but it's important to translate even the less-used languages too, because it will make the barrier to entry to the servers lower for people who speak those languages.</p>
            <p>Of course, translation is an ongoing task as new features are added to the servers and website, so there will be plenty to keep Monti and the team busy for quite some time.</p>
