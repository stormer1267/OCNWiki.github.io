A fair amount of development time this week was focused on fixing some of the bugs arising from that change, but in addition we got a few other updates as well...</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Moderators in observer mode now have the ability to 'listen in' to team chats. This means they will be able to moderate the chat more effectively without having to join a team and take up a slot.</li>
              <li>Spawn point generation code has been improved. Map creators can now generate safe random spawn points in large areas, and combine that with spreading enemies apart from each other, which will be very useful for FFA gamemodes.</li>
              <li>Lots of other improvements under the hood.</li>

            </div>
            <p>The Last Life, a Blitz event, started its double elimination, playoffs portion yesterday. Only half of the original 40 teams qualified, and it was definitely an action-packed day filled with upsets and tense matches - teams put everything on the table.</p>
            <p>JaysonFals, after getting placed in the lower bracket, Round 2, had a long streak of wins against strong opponents. They made it to semis of the Lower Bracket, where they got knocked out by PureBlox, a team predicted by most to get eliminated in Round 3. There were also other intense win streaks. LunGGlove, seeded 16th, won their way into the Winners Finals along with Kyudo.</p>
            <p>As in the group stages, matches unfortunately ran past their expected times. Along with the long matches, there were some slight problems caused by teams scrambling to field 8 players. In total, the event ran 3 hours over its expected finishing time, but most teams were very understanding. </p>
            <p>Out of Saturday's matches, the remaining three teams are LunGGlove, Kyudo, and PureBlox. These three will be facing off later today, so tune in to <a href="https://oc.tc/live">oc.tc/live</a> to watch what should be a thrilling close to a great tournament! Good luck to all of those playing!</p>

              <h3 id="staffmeeting">Staff Meeting</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Dozens of staff members attended a meeting last Sunday to discuss a variety of topics from community relations to the new player experience. Though the name “staff meeting” may conjure up images of a board room with discussion as gray as its occupants' suits, the mumble-based meeting was a lively discussion about key topics related to the Overcast Network.</p>
            <p>The most prominent topic was the “new player experience”, or how brand new players are introduced to the network. Moderators examined various ways to make the server more welcoming to newcomers, such as making knowledge about the map making system more accessible on the servers, more forcefully directing people to the website and tutorials with incentives like longer temporary donor permissions, introducing new tips, and having casual events aimed at fostering a sense of community.</p>
            <p>Other topics included ideas for new premium perks, feedback on in-progress changes to combat stacking, and changes to the in-game private messaging system. As with all staff meetings, these ideas were merely discussed. No specific request or idea will necessarily be implemented simply because moderators liked them. </p>
