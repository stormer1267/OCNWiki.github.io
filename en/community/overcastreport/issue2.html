            <p><a href="https://oc.tc/ElectroidFilms">ElectroidFilms</a> says it's time to talk Arcade, and boy was he right! In his <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/557b19ee67d5223706006c3a">Status Update</a>, he talks about the goal of the arcade, the requirements for Arcade maps, and even some current maps in development. Now that <a href="https://oc.tc/Cubist">Cubist</a> has finished the Free for All module, the fun can begin. Our Map Developers will be working hard on making maps for the Arcade, but as always, we turn to the community to help us innovate and progress. We can't wait to see what you will come up with, and how much fun we will have in the process.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The servers have been upgraded to Minecraft 1.8.7, which includes some minor features and bug fixes from Mojang. A Bukkit bug that broke icarus cannons was also fixed; however, the upgrade introduced a new TNT bug that is causing spread cannons to occasionally self-destruct, and developers are looking into it. Please let us know on our <a href="https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/Issues">issue tracker</a> if you're aware of any other TNT-related bugs - and if possible, provide clear explanations (video would be ideal).</p>
            <p>Also, <a href="https://oc.tc/YukonAppleGeek">YukonAppleGeek</a> is now back to working full time on development, so expect to see more fun stuff happening in this area this summer.</p>

            </div>
            <p>We are pleased to announce a <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/557c6d4b67d522f1d0008897">Tournament Map Making Event</a>! This event will be a test of who can make the best Capture the Flag, or King of the Flag map, especially for tournament play.</p>
            <p>There will be two weeks for maps to be made, and then the testing and judging will begin. The lead builder of the top 3 maps will earn a "Map Residency" to further develop and polish their map before being accepted into the Tournament 10 map pool by the Event Coordinators. This is the first time the community has had the opportunity to earn a spot in a tournament's map pool, so we can't wait to see the level of competition that will come through. </p>
            <p>Rules, dates, and more specifics can be found in the <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/557c6d4b67d522f1d0008897">announcement thread</a>. Best of luck to any and all map makers who decide to join!</p>
