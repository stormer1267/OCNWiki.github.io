###Creating an issue or a pull request

We encourage people to help with the project so it will include as much information as possible to help players more and more but there are a few things that you need to know before submitting a bug report or creating a pull request to add a feature.

When creating an issue:

* Make sure that the title describes the issue as best as possible without being too long. Titles such as "Wiki broken" are not good.
* Be clear and concise in your description. More detailed information is always great and helps us a lot more than just saying "it's not working".
* Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue is not a duplicate.
* Use a *vanilla* environment, making sure to remove any browser extensions which may be causing the issue in the first place.
* Do not bump issues to receive a response. All issues are seen.
* Do not argue unproductively in an issues or pull requests comments.
* Do not re-create an issue you feel unjustly closed. You can comment on the closed one.
* Do not create disrespectful or inflammatory comments.
* Please avoid commenting on issues with "+1" or such. Try to give constructive criticism.
* Content should be grammatically correct and the spelling should be US English, e.g. Color not Colour.

When creating a pull request make sure to follow the above. In the code it self, please make sure that it is properly formatted. Please leave your Minecraft IGN in the pull-request so we can later add you to the contributors page if your pull-request gets accepted.

If you are creating an issue for your resource pack please note that we only add resource packs that are regularly being updated. You also have to provide a 500x500 image (.png format) that we can use as a thumbnail. We do not need a download to your pack but we do need a forum thread to where you posted the resource pack.
